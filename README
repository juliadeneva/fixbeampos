Fixbeampos fixes coordinates in the main header of Mock psrfits files taken
with ALFA up to 28 Jan. 2010. Up to that date, coordinates in the headers 
and rows of side beam (beams 1-6) data files were not calculated correctly by
the Mock data-writing software. Data files from beam 0 are fine. 

Data with HDRVER of 3.43 or greater in the main header are not affected. 

The program needs a beam 0 file--it will use the positions in its header and
rows to calculate the correct positions of the side beams' headers and rows,
and will correct the side beam files if they are present in the current
directory. HDRVER in the main header of side beam files will be changed
to 3.43. A new field FIXDATE will be added to the main header of side beam
files to record the date on which they were corrected. 

Fields fixed in main header:
HDRVER, RA, DEC, STT_CRD1, STT_CRD2, STP_CRD1, STP_CRD2 (the latter two pairs 
of parameters are "start coordinates" and "stop coordinates", which are equal 
to RA,DEC)

Fields fixed in rows:
RA_SUB, DEC_SUB, TEL_AZ, TEL_ZEN, GLON_SUB, GLAT_SUB

The calculated RA, DEC, GL & GB for side beams based on beam 0 values are 
within a few arcsec of actual positions (from tests on data where both header 
and rows positions were correct for all beams). The calculated AZ & ZA may be 
up to 1.5 arcmin from actual positions. This is most likely due to the fact 
that the pointing model (which is mapped over AZ & ZA) is not taken into 
account by this code, while it is used during observations to convert encoder 
positions to the coordinates actually recorded in data files.
