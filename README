Fixbeampos fixes coordinates in the main header of Mock psrfits files taken
with ALFA up to 28 Jan. 2010. Up to that date, coordinates in the headers 
and rows of side beam (beams 1-6) data files were not calculated correctly by
the Mock data-writing software. Data files from beam 0 are fine. 

Data with HDRVER of 3.43 or greater in the main header are not affected. 

The program needs a beam 0 file--it will then extract the RA & DEC from its 
main header and use a text file with beam offsets (alfa_offsets.tcl) to 
calculate the side beam positions first in AZ,ZA, then transform to RA,DEC in
the J2000 coordinate system. 

Version number (HDRVER) in main header is updated to 3.429. Data with HDRVER
 of 3.43 or greater are not changed. 

TO DO:

Fix RA, DEC, AZ, ZA, GL, and GB in each row of affected Mock data files.
